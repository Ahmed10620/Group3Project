        <h2 class="section-title">More About Us</h2>
        <p>We are a group of students born and raised in Qatar, where each of us graduated from different high schools across the country. Our shared interest in technology and cybersecurity led us to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a major in Cybersecurity at Barzan University College. Outside of academics, we all enjoy gaming, which is a common hobby that brought us together and continues to strengthen our teamwork and creativity.</p>
